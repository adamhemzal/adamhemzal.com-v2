# React Movie App
---

React Movie is a movie application built with React, Context API, [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), and [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). It was built as a part one of the [BCIT](https://www.bcit.ca/) courses. The application uses The Movie Database [(TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to retrieve movie data and React handles the front-end data display. The application can show movies based on Popularity, Top Rated, Now Playing, and Upcoming. This is a team project created with my colleague [Billy Bui](https://billybui.io/).

My role included designing the app using AdobeXD and participating as a software developer on building the application together with my colleague [Billy](https://billybui.io/).
