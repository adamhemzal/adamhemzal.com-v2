# Barum Czech Rally Zlin

---

Barum Czech Rally Zlin is company which organize a rally competition every year in a city Zlin, Czech Republic. Client wanted to provide fans an electronical version of their maps. 

We worked in 2 persons team. My colleague in the role of project manager and me in the role of software developer. Client's employers didn't have a knowledge of React that time so we decided to use the simplest tools as possible - jQuery with LeafletJS and plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  

My role included building the app from scratch and communicating functional features, design and other changes to my colleague and client. All data are stored locally in JSON files and loaded by amazing library LeafletJS.
